Trovly - Role Suggester
===========================
Analyzes your resume and suggests job roles you'd be a strong fit for.

Usage:
  python roles.py                  → Suggest roles from your resume
  python roles.py --top 20         → Show top 20 matches
  python roles.py --stretch        → Include stretch roles
  python roles.py --add-queries    → Auto-add top roles to SEARCH_QUERIES
